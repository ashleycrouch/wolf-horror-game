    message: There you are, [White Wolf]. Getting curious, are we? I want to know
      why the air has changed as much as you, but try not to wander too far.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 8a56cd10a38410c4fb89f938dcfd00bd, type: 2}
    message: "You worried our leader and didn\u2019t even bring back a snack. How
      rude."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7f442fb573d75694dab7871dbab85cf0, type: 2}
    message: "Really thought you were gonna solve the mysteries of the forest when
      Dena can\u2019t? Hah!"
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: eddbad8f6fd407441928515a2d69acc5, type: 2}
    message: "Leave them be, you two. [White Wolf] has yet to learn how to hunt and
      it\u2019s only natural they\u2019re curious."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 1e918cc273bee9c48955b3fe731e3392, type: 2}
    message: Mekki and Benti lower their heads.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 04dbd468dd9a3cd499ff8c8c8336d408, type: 2}
    message: "I think today is as good as any to teach them. Look how they\u2019ve
      grown! How about it, Dena?"
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 1e918cc273bee9c48955b3fe731e3392, type: 2}
    message: "There\u2019s a pause from Dena, her hesitation breaking the dialogue\u2019s
      initial cadence. Her head turns to look into the shadowed woods, then she returns
      her stare to answer."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: eddbad8f6fd407441928515a2d69acc5, type: 2}
    message: "You are right, Kovan. [White Wolf] isn\u2019t a pup anymore. They\u2019re
      more than capable to hunt alongside us. Everyone, ready yourselves."
